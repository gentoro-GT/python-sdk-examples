      The most up to date run book is:
      
      ```        
      {{run_book_content}}      
      ```
      
      The Run book has four information for each incident category defined on it.
      * Action: The action to be taken when the incident is reported.
      * Communication: How the incident should be communicated.
      * Timeline: What is the timeline between the incident report and the expected resolution.
      * Notify: The list of one or more Slack channels, that should be notified when the incident is reported.      
  
      This is the incident reported by the user:
      
      ```      
      {{incident_report}}      
      ```
      
      Based on the information provided, go through the following steps:
      
      1. Analise the incident reported and match with one of the incident categories present in the run book.

      4. Once all necessary steps are completed successfully, call the tool/function named `end_graph`, passing the summary of the actions taken.
      5. If any step fails, call the tool/function named `end_graph`, passing the summary
